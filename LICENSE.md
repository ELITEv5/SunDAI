## ⚠️ CRITICAL DISCLAIMERS

### No Issuer, Controller, or Legal Entity

**There is no company, foundation, or legal entity behind SunDAI.**

- The smart contracts are deployed immutably with no admin keys
- The creators (ELITE TEAM6) have no ongoing control, ownership, or liability
- This is open-source software released to the public domain
- The protocol operates autonomously without human intervention
- **No one can pause, upgrade, modify, or control these contracts**

---

### Financial Risk Warning

SunDAI is experimental financial software. By using this protocol, you acknowledge and accept the following risks:

#### Smart Contract Risk
- The contracts are **immutable** and cannot be upgraded or fixed
- Any bugs or vulnerabilities discovered after deployment **cannot be patched**
- The protocol **has not been audited** by third-party security firms
- You may **lose all deposited collateral**

#### Oracle Risk
- Price feeds depend on DEX liquidity and may be manipulated
- Oracle uses 4-hour confirmation on large price drops (intentional delay)
- Price updates require user interactions or manual poke() calls
- Stale oracle data could affect liquidation timing

#### Liquidation Risk
- Your collateral **will be liquidated** if vault health falls below 110%
- Interest accrues continuously and can push vaults into liquidation
- You are **solely responsible** for monitoring your position
- No warnings, no grace period, no customer service

#### Market Risk
- Cryptocurrency prices are extremely volatile
- PLS price can drop 30-50%+ in hours during crashes
- Even healthy vaults can be liquidated in extreme conditions
- Past performance does not indicate future results

#### Total Loss Risk
- You may lose **100% of deposited collateral**
- There is no insurance, no backstop, no recovery mechanism
- Once liquidated, your collateral is gone permanently

---

### Not a Payment Stablecoin

**SunDAI is NOT a reserve-backed stablecoin.**

pSunDAI is an experimental **synthetic stable asset** created through over-collateralized debt positions. Key differences from payment stablecoins (USDC, USDT):

- ❌ **No USD reserves** - Protocol holds no dollars, treasuries, or reserve assets
- ❌ **No redemption rights** - You cannot redeem pSunDAI for $1 from anyone
- ❌ **No issuer** - Users self-mint tokens by locking PLS collateral in smart contracts
- ❌ **No custody** - No entity custodies funds or controls the protocol
- ❌ **No $1 guarantee** - Peg maintained by market arbitrage, not protocol guarantee
- ❌ **No payment system** - Not designed or intended for payments or remittances

#### Legal Classification

pSunDAI is a **synthetic derivative token**, not a payment stablecoin under proposed US regulations. It operates similarly to:
- MakerDAO's DAI (algorithmic, over-collateralized)
- Liquity's LUSD (CDP-based, immutable)
- Reflexer's RAI (floating peg, no governance)

This is **software that creates synthetic assets**, not a financial service.

---

### No Warranties or Guarantees

- The protocol is provided **"AS-IS"** with **ZERO guarantees** of:
  - Uptime or availability
  - Peg stability (may depeg at any time)
  - Functionality or correctness
  - Security or safety
- ELITE TEAM6 provides **no support, no customer service, no assistance**
- **No one is responsible if this breaks, fails, or loses your money**

---

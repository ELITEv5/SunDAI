# 🌞 SunDAI ASA — Autonomous Stable Asset

> **The World’s First Fully Autonomous Stable Asset Vault.**  
> Built on PulseChain. Designed for every chain.  
> Developed by **ELITE TEAM6**.

## 🧠 Overview

**SunDAI ASA** is an **Autonomous Stable Asset (ASA)** — a fully on-chain, immutable vault system that enables users to mint a decentralized stable asset (**pSunDAI**) by locking native collateral such as **PLS**, **wETH**, **HEX**, or other on-chain assets.

Unlike fiat-backed stablecoins, **SunDAI is algorithmic, collateralized, and self-governing** — no keys, no banks, no off-chain dependency.

SunDAI runs on math, collateral, and immutable code.

## ⚙️ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| 🧱 **Immutable Vaults** | Each user has a unique, keyless vault. No admin intervention required. |
| 🧮 **Autonomous Oracle System** | Self-refreshing oracle with ±10% clamp protection and stale-price fallback. |
| 💎 **Full Autonomy** | No governance keys. No pausable contracts. No upgrades. 100% autonomous. |
| 💰 **0.5% Annual Stability Fee** | Accrued automatically per vault — no interest rates, no custodians. |
| ⚖️ **Safe Collateralization (150%)** | Over-collateralized design protects against volatility and depegging. |
| 🔥 **Liquidation Auctions** | Fair, time-based liquidation rewards keep vaults balanced without admin action. |
| ⚡ **One-Click UX** | Deposit+Mint and Repay+Withdraw in a single transaction. |
| 🌍 **Chain-Agnostic Architecture** | Built to support native assets across EVM-compatible chains (PLS, ETH, BNB, etc.). |

## 🧩 Core Contracts

| Contract | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `pSunDAI_ASA_Token.sol` | ERC-20 stable asset token (Autonomous Stable Asset). |
| `pSunDAI_Stable_Vaultv3.sol` | Core vault logic — handles deposits, minting, repayment, withdrawals, and liquidations. |
| `pSunDAIoraclePLSX3.sol` | Oracle contract that aggregates stable pair data and clamps volatility. |

All contracts are immutable and deployed without admin ownership.

## 🔒 Security & Design

SunDAI ASA is engineered for **complete autonomy and transparency**:
- No upgradeable proxies.
- No admin or owner functions.
- No centralized minting.
- No emergency control.
- Immutable after deployment.

If the oracle stops updating, users can still:
- Repay debt.  
- Withdraw collateral (if debt = 0).  
- Liquidate unsafe vaults.

This ensures **liveness, solvency, and permissionless safety** under all conditions.

---

## 🧠 Economic Model

- **Collateral Ratio:** 150% (minting), 110% (liquidation threshold).  
- **Stability Fee:** 0.5% annualized, automatically accrued.  
- **Liquidation Bonus:** 2%–5% dynamic, time-weighted.  
- **System Pause:** Automatic minting halt if global ratio < 130%.  

All parameters are **hardcoded and immutable** — no DAO votes or admin adjustments.

## 💬 Example Workflow

1. Deposit **WPLS** (or native wrapped token).  
2. Mint **pSunDAI** up to 66% of your collateral value.  
3. Repay any amount of pSunDAI at any time.  
4. Withdraw collateral once debt is cleared.  
5. Vault auto-rebalances and accrues minimal stability fees.

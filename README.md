## Overview
**SunDAI ASA** is a completely autonomous, immutable vault system that lets anyone mint **pSunDAI** — a decentralized, USD-pegged stable asset — by locking PLS as collateral.

No admins. No keepers. No governance. No upgrades.  
Just pure math, on-chain collateral, and self-healing code.

**SunDAI runs forever.**

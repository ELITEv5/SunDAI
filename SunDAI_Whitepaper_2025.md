### Abstract  
A purely peer-to-protocol stable asset system allows value to be issued, collateralized, and redeemed without reliance on banks, custodians, or governance. SunDAI introduces an **autonomous stable asset (ASA)** model where stability arises from algorithmic collateralization and self-referential oracle consensus rather than fiat reserves. Each SunDAI token is minted against native crypto collateral (e.g., PLS, wETH, HEX, SOL, BNB) held in immutable vaults. The protocol enforces solvency through deterministic mathematics, not management discretion, enabling a globally neutral, censorship-resistant unit of account for decentralized finance.

### 1. Introduction  
Centralized stablecoins tie the freedom of digital assets to the liabilities of banking infrastructure. Their issuers retain the power to freeze accounts, censor transactions, and redefine value through policy. In contrast, SunDAI operates as an *autonomous stable asset* — a contract system that self-balances supply, collateral, and price through immutable logic. No company holds reserves, no authority redeems tokens; the collateral itself guarantees solvency. Like Bitcoin detached money from intermediaries, SunDAI detaches stability from custodianship.

---

### 2. System Overview  
Each participant controls a **vault**. By locking supported collateral, the vault issues pSunDAI.  

\[
\text{Collateral Ratio} = \frac{C \times P}{D} \times 100
\]

Where *C* is collateral, *P* the oracle price, *D* the debt.  
A minimum ratio of **150%** is enforced; liquidation begins below **110%**.  
All operations — deposit, mint, repay, withdraw — execute autonomously within the contract, without admin keys.

---

### 3. Oracle Mechanism  
SunDAI’s oracle aggregates price data from multiple wrapped-stable pairs (USDC, DAI, USDT on PulseChain or equivalents).  
A moving-median filter with ±10% clamp ensures resistance to flash deviations.  
If data becomes stale (> 24h), the last safe price is reused until the next valid update, guaranteeing continuity even under network isolation.

---

### 4. Autonomous Interest and Stability Fee  
A time-based stability fee of 0.5% per year accrues on outstanding debt:

\[
F = D \times \frac{r \times t}{T}
\]

Where *r* = 50 bps, *T* = 31,536,000 seconds.  
Accrual happens automatically on each interaction, distributing cost proportionally across time without external triggers.

---

### 5. Liquidation and Recovery  
When \( R < 110\% \), vaults enter liquidation.  
A liquidator burns SunDAI to repay debt and receives collateral plus a dynamic bonus (2–5%) depending on auction time elapsed.  
The mechanism restores system health while rewarding honest arbitrage, maintaining global collateralization above 130%.

---

### 6. System Health  
The protocol tracks total collateral *Cₜ* and total debt *Dₜ*:

\[
\text{System Health} = \frac{Cₜ × P}{Dₜ} × 100
\]

Minting halts if this metric falls below 130%, ensuring aggregate solvency even if individual vaults fail.

---

### 7. Autonomy and Governance  
SunDAI has no owner, operator, or multisig.  
Deployment locks all parameters.  
Neither the oracle, token, nor vault accept privileged upgrades.  
In practice, this transforms the protocol into a public utility — permanent, borderless, incorruptible.

---

### 8. Economic Incentives  
Borrowers obtain liquidity against volatile assets without selling them.  
Liquidators and arbitrageurs maintain balance.  
Holders benefit from a stable, censorship-resistant medium.  
All roles interact voluntarily through transparent code, forming a self-sustaining market of incentives rather than mandates.

---

### 9. Security Considerations  
Safeguards include:  
* Price clamping ±10% per update to resist oracle manipulation.  
* Withdraw cooldowns (5 minutes) preventing rapid drain.  
* 24h oracle stale lock to halt minting under uncertainty.  
* Dust forgiveness removing negligible residuals.  
* Fully on-chain accounting; no external calls beyond wrapped collateral.  

These collectively eliminate the historical failure modes of algorithmic stablecoins — governance attacks, re-hypothecation, or dependency on debt auctions.

---

### 10. Cross-Chain Perspective  
Each SunDAI deployment is *native* to its host chain.  
By anchoring to local assets (PLS, ETH, BNB, SOL, HEX), the system preserves sovereignty while allowing cross-chain arbitrage via decentralized bridges.  
No wrapped fiat is required for parity; stability arises from economic geometry, not peg enforcement.

---

### 11. Use Cases  
* Collateralized borrowing without intermediaries.  
* Decentralized payments in autonomous economies.  
* Liquidity base for DeFi protocols seeking non-custodial stability.  
* Value storage independent of national currency exposure.  

---

### 12. Conclusion  
SunDAI represents a natural evolution of decentralized finance: a system that merges algorithmic precision with immutable autonomy.  
Where Bitcoin freed *money* from banks, SunDAI frees *stability* from permission.  
Its logic lives forever on-chain, requiring no trust — only mathematics.
